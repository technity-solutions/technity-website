        The name <span class="font-semibold text-orange-500">TechNity</span> comes from a mix of <span class="font-medium text-orange-500">"Technology"</span> and <span class="font-medium text-orange-500">"Nitya"</span>, a Sanskrit word that means endless or eternal. For us, it's more than just a name. It's about the belief that technology never stops evolving, and neither do we. We want to build solutions that last, grow, and adapt with time, just like the endless flow of ideas and possibilities that inspire us every day.
